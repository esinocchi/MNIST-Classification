# MNIST-Classification

This repository contains a neural network model implemented in Python for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is developed using the PyTorch framework and is presented in a Jupyter Notebook for ease of understanding and experimentation.

## Contents

- `net.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook detailing the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License under which this project is distributed.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Utilizes PyTorch's `torchvision` library to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
- **Model Architecture**: Implements a neural network with layers optimized for digit recognition tasks.
- **Training**: Includes code for training the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
- **Evaluation**: Provides methods to assess the model's performance on test data.
